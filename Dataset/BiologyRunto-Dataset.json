This significant difference is due to the fact that the most common forms of color blindness are X-linked recessive traits. Since males have only one X chromosome, a single mutated gene on that chromosome will result in color blindness. Females, having two X chromosomes, would need mutations on both to express the condition, which is much rarer."

        "output": "The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously during DNA replication. Since the lagging strand is oriented in the opposite direction of the replication fork, DNA polymerase must synthesize the new DNA strand in short fragments called Okazaki fragments. Each fragment begins with an RNA primer, and DNA polymerase extends the fragment by adding nucleotides to the 3' end. Once an Okazaki fragment is synthesized, the RNA primer is removed, and the gaps between fragments are filled in by DNA polymerase. Finally, the enzyme DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together, creating a continuous DNA strand."

After DNA polymerase synthesizes the short fragments, DNA ligase catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the fragments, sealing the gaps and creating a continuous DNA strand. This process ensures the integrity and continuity of the newly synthesized DNA."
